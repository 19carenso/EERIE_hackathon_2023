Repository of the first EERIE hackathon
=======================================

This repo contain infromation necessary for data access, and examples of data processing for 1st EERIE hackathon

Data
====

The EERIE simulations are not ready yet, so initially examples will be based on data from other projects. We will gradually update examples with EERIE simulations when they become available.

Examples
========

* Basics (acces data on original grid, get data for one time step, open grid, have a look at data)
* Regriding to regular grid
* Plot global and regional map
* Find a point nearest to coorrdinates, extract timeseries
* Find a set of points closest to transect, plot transect
* Effectve, parallel aggregations
* Area integral, Volume integral
* Curl
* Transport through transect
* Compute AMOC

Standard variables (tentative)
==============================

* SST, daily
* SSH, daily
* ...
