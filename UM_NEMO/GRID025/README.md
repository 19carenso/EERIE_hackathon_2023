# Regridded data from UM-NEMO simulations

Some examples of working with regridded data and products derived from the regridded data.

## Notebooks

* START_HERE.ipynb - load and plot regridded ocean data.
* eddy_tracks.ipynb - load and plot the output from the eddy tracker.

## Data collections

The examples here load the files directly. Please see the intake catalogue example in the `UM_NEMO` directory in the level above for an example catalogue.
