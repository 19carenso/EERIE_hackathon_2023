# IFS data from IFS-FESOM simulations

Currently for examples we use [nextGEMS Cycle 3](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/DYAMOND/NextGEMS/index.html#id4) simulations. Later they will be updated with EERIE simulations.

## Notebooks

* START_HERE.ipynb - simple, basic example, without a lot of explanations. Access to data, plot

## Data collections

FESOM data stored in [intake catalog](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html). We still figuring out how to best represent infromation about stored there.
